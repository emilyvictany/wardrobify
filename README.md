## Shoes microservice

The Shoes microservice will poll data from the wardrop_api Bin Model. It will then use that data to create a BinVO model to allow us to locate where the shoe is placed in which bin and which closet.

## Hats microservice

Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here.
