## Shoes microservice

Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here.

## Hats microservice

For backend, created a Hat model and LocationVO model with relevant attributes (i.e. fabric, style, color, picture, location for Hat model). Implemented a poller to pull Location data from the Wardrobe API, which is then integrated with the Hats microservice LocationVO model. Created React components for frontend to allow user to add a hat, delete a hat, and view all hats that are stored in the database.
